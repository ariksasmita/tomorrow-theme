## Tomorrow Themes for Netbeans 7.x ##

**NB** These are incomplete at the moment. They all work, but they all have some minor
issues that still need to be addressed. Nothing major though and they can all be used
without too much trouble.

### How-to Install ###
Create a zip archive of each directory and import those zips directly into Netbeans.

If you're on unix/linux/os x:
    # Open a terminal/shell
    # Change to the theme directory you want to zip (`cd Tomorrow`)
    # `zip -rv ../Tomorrow.zip *`

If you're on Windows, use your favorite zip utility and zip the *contents* of the theme folder

After that...
    # Open Netbeans and go to Preferences
    # Click the 'Import' button and select the zip.
